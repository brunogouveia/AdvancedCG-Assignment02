hw03: Procedural Textures

Bruno Henrique Gouveia

I implemented a spiral procedural texture and a noisy texture using Perlin noise.

Demonstrates stored ad procedural textures using the
brick and mandelbrot shaders.

Key bindings
  m/M        Cycle through shaders
  o/O        Cycle through objects
  p/P        Toggle between orthogonal & perspective projection
  s/S        Start/stop light
  X/Y/Z      Change mandelbrot parameters
  -/+        Change light elevation
  a          Toggle axes
  arrows     Change view angle
  PgDn/PgUp  Zoom in and out
  0          Reset view angle
  ESC        Exit
